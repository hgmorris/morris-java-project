As a software engineer looking to further my understanding of Java, I developed a simple task management application. This software allows users to create a list of tasks, view them, and mark tasks as complete. My main goal was to learn and demonstrate basic Java syntax and object-oriented programming principles, including class creation, method definitions, handling user input, and managing a dynamic list of objects.

To see this software in action and get an overview of the code, I've created a demonstration video. This 4-5 minute demo showcases the software running in a console environment and walks through the code, highlighting what I've learned about Java language syntax.

I used the following tools to develop the software:

 Visual Studio Code: An editor for writing and editing the Java code with helpful extensions like the Java Extension Pack, which provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging capabilities.

Java Development Kit (JDK): The essential toolkit for compiling and running Java applications. I used JDK version 11 for this project.

The primary programming language used is Java. This project did not require external libraries, relying instead on the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) API for foundational features like collection management and user input handling.

Useful Websites

Throughout the development of this project, I found several websites particularly helpful:

 Oracle Java Documentation: Official Java documentation, invaluable for understanding Java's built-in classes and methods.
Stack Overflow: A go-to resource for troubleshooting and community advice on specific Java programming challenges.

Future Work

Moving forward, there are several enhancements I plan to implement to improve the functionality and user experience of the task manager:

 Data Persistence: Currently, tasks are lost once the application closes. Implementing file I/O to save and load tasks would be a significant improvement.
Task Deletion and Editing: Adding functionality to remove or edit existing tasks would make the application more versatile.
User Interface Enhancements: Improving the console interface for a more user-friendly experience, possibly including error handling for invalid inputs.
